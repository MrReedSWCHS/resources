 [mehackit](https://sonic-pi.mehackit.org/exercises/en/01-introduction/01-introduction.html) | Excellent and comprehensive course from beginner to expert. Lots of music theory graphics/explanations 
[Raspberry Pi foundation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-sonic-pi) | More basic but still very useful course from the Pi foundation.
[Sam Aaron's tutorial](https://sonic-pi.net/tutorial.html) | The original tutorial, as included in the program itself. Brilliantly written and totally comprehensive, if overfacing for the beginner/younger student.
